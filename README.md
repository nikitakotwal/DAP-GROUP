The best definition of market analysis is a data mining approach used to identify buying trends in any retail environment. Market basket analysis seeks to comprehend consumer behavior by establishing connections between the goods that consumers purchase. For instance, buyers of green tea are more inclined to purchase honey as well. As a result, Market Basket Analysis would quantitatively prove that Green Tea and Honey are related. The same is true with jam, butter, and bread.
